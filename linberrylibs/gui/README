This is the GUI sub-project of the Linberry project.  You will need the
Linberry library compiled and installed to use this.  This directory
contains a fully standalone build tree, but can optionally be built
automatically when you build Linberry if you use the --enable-gui
configure option.

See doc/www/index.html for more documentation.
