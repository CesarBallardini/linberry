Introduction:
-------------
Linberry is a GPL C++ library and application set to interface with
USB BlackBerry handheld devices on Linux.  This is one of
Net Direct Inc.'s (http://www.netdirect.ca/) open source projects.

The SourceForge project page can be found at:
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/linberry/

The documentation page can be found at:
	http://www.netdirect.ca/software/packages/linberry
	or

	or
	http://netdirect.ca/linberry (redirect)

The same documentation (and perhaps more up to date) can be found in the
doc/www/ directory.  If you have php CLI installed, run the static.sh
script to generate the HTML, then start reading at index.html.

Enjoy!
